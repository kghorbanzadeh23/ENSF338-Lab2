 1. I would make it so if you are looking for a room <= 130 turn left. Then if it's greater turn right.

 2. It would take 28 steps because each step is passing a room.

 3. This would be neither as there are worst cases.

 4. The best cases would EY100 or EY138 as either direction you take you will have run in to it on the first room. The worst case would be EY130 as you would turn left it would take 30 steps to run in to it and that would be the most of every other room. 

 5. I would make the middle point EY118 as it seems to be in the middle. So if looking for a room <= 118 turn left and then if it's room > 118 turn right. As then the worst case would be 18 steps.
